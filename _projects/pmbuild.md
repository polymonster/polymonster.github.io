This build system originated in pmtech but is now also being used in the engine I am currently developing at [Flavourworks](https://www.flavourworks.co/). It is written in python and provides a command-line interface to configure and build code and data for different platforms.

There is a [live demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-wPJXZ_oDA) of pmbuild in action on youtube and documentation on the GitHub page.
