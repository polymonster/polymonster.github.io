Hotline is a modern hot-reload graphics engine which allows you to edit Rust code, render configs, render graphs and pipelines all interactively while the client is running.

Building on my game and graphics engine experiences I began a new project to focus solely on modern graphics APIs and hardware. I decided to do it all in Rust and move away from my C++ background to try and push the Rust gamedev ecosystem and learn a new language. Hotline is still very much work in progress but it has a decent feature set now working.
