A premake5 module for Android Studio, it plugs nicely into any existing premake workflows and abstracts a lot of the complications of Android SDK/NDK, Gradle and CMake. This repository is my most contributed to and it has had nice additions from other users and companies who have found it useful for multi-platform development.
