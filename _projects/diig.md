A music discovery app that I built to improve the UX of browsing on various online record stores. It features an iOS app with super responsive audio playback written in C++. Multiple custom scrapers written in python to extract data from my favourite records stores into a unified schema and a firebase database to store the information with scrapers running nightly on GitHub actions.

This is just the start of the project, I plan to add a website and more to the ecosystem.

I uploaded some videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLReR5EQ5ED7Oca7bp3Gv9S3vb4lYcDKZc) about it's development.
